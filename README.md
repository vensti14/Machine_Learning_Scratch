# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains a structured collection of machine learning
algorithms implemented from scratch and using standard libraries.

Inspired by:
- An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLP)
- The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)

Focus:
- Mathematical intuition
- Clean implementations
- Practical behavior and limitations of algorithms
